# TheManWithNoNameTag

Written (yet not finished) as part of an online game jam. Worked with a couple people I met in a game development Discord server, the Game Dev League.

The game itself was written in Python using PyGame, build on top of my custom-written Stellar Engine. Stellar offloads the basic "game stuff" and streamlines the development a little.

The game features entirely custom artwork, music, and sound effects.
